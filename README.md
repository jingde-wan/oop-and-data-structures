# OOP and Data Structures

COMP SCI 300: Programming II

Topics include: 

  Unit 1 - Getting Started with Java Programming: We'll first review  the Java syntax and then learn how to use objects in Java (Arrays, ArrayLists, Scanner, String, Wrapper classes, and Exceptions).

  Unit 2 - Object-Oriented Design: We'll explore the OO programming paradigm by organizing our code into instantiable classes, and relating those classes to other classes using inheritance, interfaces, and generics.  Through this exploration, we'll deepen our understanding of the benefits associated with encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.  We'll also make use of object diagrams and pay close attention to the underlying representations of these objects in memory.

  Unit 3 - Algorithms and Building Blocks: We'll explore together and try to understand the concepts surrounding the efficiency of an algorithm before we start building data structures in Unit4. We aim also in this unit to explore basic building blocks in algorithms which are search and sorting, and explore how sorting algorithms work and compare under different circumstances. We are also going to learn a new design approach: recursion, and have a better understanding how recursion and divide and conquer design approaches apply to sorting.

  Units 4 and 5 - Data Structures (linear and hierarchical): We'll compare different algorithms and data structure implementations of several abstract data types.  Analyzing the time complexities of these implementations will lead us to some useful optimizations, and will provide a foundation for developing more complex algorithms and data structures.  In this course we'll specifically focus on implementations of list, stack, queue, and priority queue interfaces, as well as binary search trees.

  Note: that COMP SCI 300 uses the Java programming language for all assignments, exams, lectures, and readings.
